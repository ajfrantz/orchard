# First Orchard Win Rates

While playing "My Very First Games - First Orchard" with our daughter, my wife and I speculated as to win rates with
various rules tweaks.

I'm sure there's an analytic way to do this analysis, but it was quick enough to "just try it," so here we are.

With a billion games simulated in each configuration...

```
Estimating win rate for 'easy' mode (start pos = 6)...
Won 768489368, lost 231510632, win rate 76.85%
Estimating win rate for 'normal' mode (start pos = 5)...
Won 631358653, lost 368641347, win rate 63.14%
Estimating win rate for 'hard' mode (start pos = 4)...
Won 459398164, lost 540601836, win rate 45.94%
